                  Iâ€™m a career changer with web and graphic design, data
                  management, and communication experience. I have an MA degree
                  in Media Arts and before I worked in marketing, in archive
                  digitization, made freelance websites and graphic designs,
                  organized some little projects for my NGO.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It was more than a year ago when I decided to change my
                  work path and achieve specific knowledge in web development. So
                  I made my big step.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  After quitting my job I attended &#160;

                  's Junior Front-End course. Like I'm enthusiastic about
                  "making things work" and have the desire to create amazing
                  things from scratch, after all choosing the Front-End was more
                  than evident for me.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  There I have learned that building beautiful visual
                  experiences and turning them into interactive ones is a very
                  complex workflow. Since then I have had the perpetual feeling,
                  that the more I understand, the more questions I have. Finally
                  being devoted and decided helps me to make the magic happen.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  So here I am, ready for opportunities to become an efficient
                  part of your team where I can start my developer career!
                  Please feel free to find out more about me.
